  abstract = {The prospect of studying topological matter with the precision and control of atomic physics has driven the development of many techniques for engineering artificial magnetic fields and spin-orbit interactions. Recently, the idea of introducing nontrivial topology through the use of internal (or external) atomic states as effective ``synthetic dimensions'' has garnered attraction for its versatility and possible immunity from heating. We engineer tunable gauge fields through the local control of tunneling phases in an effective two-dimensional manifold of discrete atomic momentum states. We demonstrate the ability to create homogeneous gauge fields of arbitrary value, directly imaging the site-resolved dynamics of induced chiral currents. Furthermore, we engineer the first inhomogeneous artificial gauge fields for cold atoms, observing the magnetic reflection of atoms incident upon a step-like variation of an artificial vector potential. These results open new possibilities for the study of topological phases and localization phenomena in atomic gases.},

  abstract = {Weyl semimetals (WSMs)\textemdash materials that host exotic quasiparticles called Weyl fermions\textemdash must break either spatial inversion or time-reversal symmetry. A number of WSMs that break inversion symmetry have been identified, but showing unambiguously that a material is a time-reversal-breaking WSM is tricky. Three groups now provide spectroscopic evidence for this latter state in magnetic materials (see the Perspective by da Silva Neto). Belopolski et al. probed the material Co2MnGa using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, revealing exotic drumhead surface states. Using the same technique, Liu et al. studied the material Co3Sn2S2, which was complemented by the scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements of Morali et al. These magnetic WSM states provide an ideal setting for exotic transport effects.Science, this issue p. 1278, p. 1282, p. 1286; see also p. 1248Topological matter is known to exhibit unconventional surface states and anomalous transport owing to unusual bulk electronic topology. In this study, we use photoemission spectroscopy and quantum transport to elucidate the topology of the room temperature magnet Co2MnGa. We observe sharp bulk Weyl fermion line dispersions indicative of nontrivial topological invariants present in the magnetic phase. On the surface of the magnet, we observe electronic wave functions that take the form of drumheads, enabling us to directly visualize the crucial components of the bulk-boundary topological correspondence. By considering the Berry curvature field associated with the observed topological Weyl fermion lines, we quantitatively account for the giant anomalous Hall response observed in this magnet. Our experimental results suggest a rich interplay of strongly interacting electrons and topology in quantum matter.}

When the thickness of the quantum well is varied, the electronic state changes from a normal to an ``inverted'' type at a critical thickness dc. We show that this transition is a topological quantum phase transition between a conventional insulating phase and a phase exhibiting the QSH effect with a single pair of helical edge states. We also discuss methods for experimental detection of the QSH effect.}

  abstract = {Since the discovery of topological insulators and semimetals, there has been much research into predicting and experimentally discovering distinct classes of these materials, in which the topology of electronic states leads to robust surface states and electromagnetic responses. This apparent success, however, masks a fundamental shortcoming: topological insulators represent only a few hundred of the 200,000 stoichiometric compounds in material databases. However, it is unclear whether this low number is indicative of the esoteric nature of topological insulators or of a fundamental problem with the current approaches to finding them. Here we propose a complete electronic band theory, which builds on the conventional band theory of electrons, highlighting the link between the topology and local chemical bonding. This theory of topological quantum chemistry provides a description of the universal (across materials), global properties of all possible band structures and (weakly correlated) materials, consisting of a graph-theoretic description of momentum (reciprocal) space and a complementary group-theoretic description in real space. For all 230 crystal symmetry groups, we classify the possible band structures that arise from local atomic orbitals, and show which are topologically non-trivial. Our electronic band theory sheds new light on known topological insulators, and can be used to predict many more.}

  abstract = {The Schrieffer\textendash Wolff (SW) method is a version of degenerate perturbation theory in which the low-energy effective Hamiltonian Heff is obtained from the exact Hamiltonian by a unitary transformation decoupling the low-energy and high-energy subspaces. We give a self-contained summary of the SW method with a focus on rigorous results. We begin with an exact definition of the SW transformation in terms of the so-called direct rotation between linear subspaces. From this we obtain elementary proofs of several important properties of Heff such as the linked cluster theorem. We then study the perturbative version of the SW transformation obtained from a Taylor series representation of the direct rotation. Our perturbative approach provides a systematic diagram technique for computing high-order corrections to Heff. We then specialize the SW method to quantum spin lattices with short-range interactions. We establish unitary equivalence between effective low-energy Hamiltonians obtained using two different versions of the SW method studied in the literature. Finally, we derive an upper bound on the precision up to which the ground state energy of the nth-order effective Hamiltonian approximates the exact ground state energy.},

  abstract = {The symmetry properties of a magnetically ordered crystal are normally described in terms of the magnetic space group. But the dominant interactions, Heisenberg exchange and anisotropy fields, have more symmetry than this in that the spins may be rotated independently of the lattice. The `spin-space groups' appropriate to this symmetry are defined and described, and methods are given for finding the irreducible representations of their `groups of k'. The theory is applicable to discussions of the excitation spectra in these systems, especially spin waves and conduction electrons. Compatibility relations between the spin-space group and the magnetic space group are considered\textemdash these allow discussion of the modification of the spectra brought about by the smaller interactions which only have the lower symmetry. The groups for antiferromagnetic rutile structures, spinels and garnets are examined in detail, and applied to spin waves. A group for helical spin structures, as found in rare earth metals, is discussed in relation to the energy band structure.}

The AHE in a Weyl metal is thus shown to be a purely intrinsic, universal property, fully determined by the location of the Weyl nodes in the first Brillouin zone.},

  abstract = {Exotic phases of matter can emerge from the interplay between strong electron interactions and non-trivial topology. Materials that have non-dispersing bands in their electronic band structure, such as twisted bilayer graphene, are prime candidates for strongly interacting physics. However, existing theoretical models for obtaining these `flat bands' in crystals are often too restrictive for experimental realizations. Here we present a generic theoretical technique for constructing perfectly flat bands from bipartite crystalline lattices. Our prescription encapsulates and generalizes the various flat-band models in the literature and is applicable to systems with any orbital content, with or without spin\textendash orbit coupling. Using topological quantum chemistry, we build a complete topological classification in terms of symmetry eigenvalues of all the gapped and gapless flat bands. We also derive criteria for the existence of symmetry-protected band touching points between the flat and dispersive bands, and identify the gapped flat bands as prime candidates for fragile topological phases. Finally, we show that the set of all perfectly flat bands is finitely generated and construct the corresponding bases for all 1,651 Shubnikov space groups.}

The model represents a system with a disordered potential that varies slowly on the scale of the magnetic length, but includes quantum tunnelling and interference effects. Numerical calculations indicate that the localisation length diverges only at the centre of each Landau band. The scaling behaviour near the mobility edge is analysed: results suggest that quantum tunnelling induces crossover at the classical percolation threshold to critical behaviour similar to that found previously for a rapidly varying potential.}

  abstract = {Td-WTe2 (non-centrosymmetric and orthorhombic), a type-II Weyl semimetal, is expected to have higher-order topological phases with topologically protected, helical one-dimensional hinge states when its Weyl points are annihilated. However, the detection of these hinge states is difficult due to the semimetallic behaviour of the bulk. In this study, we have spatially resolved the hinge states by analysing the magnetic field interference of the supercurrent in Nb\textendash WTe2\textendash Nb proximity Josephson junctions. The Josephson current along the a axis of the WTe2 crystal, but not along the b axis, showed a sharp enhancement at the edges of the junction, and the amount of enhanced Josephson current was comparable to the upper limits of a single one-dimensional helical channel. Our experimental observations suggest a higher-order topological phase in WTe2 and its corresponding anisotropic topological hinge states, in agreement with theoretical calculations. Our work paves the way for the study of hinge states in topological transition-metal dichalcogenides and analogous phases.}

The Weyl semi-metallic phase appears between a resulting quantum Hall insulating phase and a normal insulating phase. Weyl fermions in this Weyl semi-metal, similar to Dirac fermions in graphene, have their lattice pseudo-spin locked to their momenta. We investigate surface states and Fermi arcs, and their evolution for different phases, by exactly diagonalizing the lattice model as well as by analyzing their topological origins.}

Despite the numerous demonstrations of 2D topological phases, few examples of 3D topological systems with TRS breaking exist. In this article, we devise a general strategy to design 3D Chern insulating (3D CI) cubic photonic crystals in a weakly TRS broken environment with orientable and arbitrarily large Chern vectors. The designs display topologically protected chiral and unidirectional surface states with disjoint equifrequency loops. The resulting crystals present the following characteristics: First, by increasing the Chern number, multiple surface states channels can be supported. Second, the Chern vector can be oriented along any direction simply changing the magnetization axis, opening up larger 3D CI/3D CI interfacing possibilities as compared to 2D. Third, by lowering the TRS breaking requirements, the system is ideal for realistic photonic applications where the magnetic response is weak.}

  abstract = {For over 100 years, the group-theoretic characterization of crystalline solids has provided the foundational language for diverse problems in physics and chemistry. However, the group theory of crystals with commensurate magnetic order has remained incomplete for the past 70 years, due to the complicated symmetries of magnetic crystals. In this work, we complete the 100-year-old problem of crystalline group theory by deriving the small corepresentations, momentum stars, compatibility relations, and magnetic elementary band corepresentations of the 1,421 magnetic space groups (MSGs), which we have made freely accessible through tools on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server. We extend Topological Quantum Chemistry to the MSGs to form a complete, real-space theory of band topology in magnetic and nonmagnetic crystalline solids \textendash{} Magnetic Topological Quantum Chemistry (MTQC). Using MTQC, we derive the complete set of symmetry-based indicators of electronic band topology, for which we identify symmetry-respecting bulk and anomalous surface and hinge states.}

We discover new types of quantum anomalies in two-dimensional systems with time-reversal symmetry (T) and discrete rotation symmetry with order of n = 2, 4, and 6 (Cn). The new anomalous states have n flavors of massless Dirac fermions protected by T and Cn, whereas any two-dimensional lattices having the two symmetries must have a multiple of 4, 8, and 12 Dirac cones for n = 2, 4, and 6, respectively. We show that these anomalous states are physically realized on the surface of new classes of topological crystalline insulators, normal to the rotation axis. Moreover, these topological crystalline insulators support n gapless one-dimensional helical mode on the otherwise fully gapped side surface, connecting the anomalous two-dimensional states on the top and bottom surfaces. The presence of these helical modes enables a new quantum device made from a topological crystalline insulator nanorod, a ``helical nanorod,'' which has a quantized longitudinal conductance of ne2/h.}

We go beyond previous work by considering lattices with atoms occupying multiple Wyckoff positions. We also provide an algorithm using the Smith normal form that systematizes the derivation. The formulas determine the corner charge in 2D atomic or fragile topological insulators, as well as in three-dimensional (3D) insulators and semimetals by studying their 2D slices in momentum space. We apply our results to a 3D tight-binding model on a body-centered tetragonal lattice, whose projection into the 2D plane has two atoms in the unit cell. Our symmetry indicators correctly describe the higher-order hinge states and Fermi arcs in cases where the existing indicators do not apply.},

  abstract = {We show how general principles of symmetry in quantum mechanics lead to twisted notions of a group representation. This framework generalizes both the classical threefold way of real/complex/ quaternionic representations as well as a corresponding tenfold way which has appeared in condensed matter and nuclear physics. We establish a foundation for discussing continuous families of quantum systems. Having done so, topological phases of quantum systems can be defined as deformation classes of continuous families of gapped Hamiltonians. For free particles, there is an additional algebraic structure on the deformation classes leading naturally to notions of twisted equivariant K-theory. In systems with a lattice of translational symmetries, we show that there is a canonical twisting of the equivariant K-theory of the Brillouin torus. We give precise mathematical definitions of two invariants of the topological phases which have played an important role in the study of topological insulators. Twisted equivariant K-theory provides a finer classification of topological insulators than has been previously available.}

  abstract = {Whereas ferromagnets have been known and used for millennia, antiferromagnets were only discovered in the 1930s1. At large scale, because of the absence of global magnetization, antiferromagnets may seem to behave like any non-magnetic material. At the microscopic level, however, the opposite alignment of spins forms a rich internal structure. In topological antiferromagnets, this internal structure leads to the possibility that the property known as the Berry phase can acquire distinct spatial textures2,3. Here we study this possibility in an antiferromagnetic axion insulator\textemdash even-layered, two-dimensional MnBi2Te4\textemdash in which spatial degrees of freedom correspond to different layers. We observe a type of Hall effect\textemdash the layer Hall effect\textemdash in which electrons from the top and bottom layers spontaneously deflect in opposite directions. Specifically, under zero electric field, even-layered MnBi2Te4 shows no anomalous Hall effect. However, applying an electric field leads to the emergence of a large, layer-polarized anomalous Hall effect of about 0.5e2/h (where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant). This layer Hall effect uncovers an unusual layer-locked Berry curvature, which serves to characterize the axion insulator state. Moreover, we find that the layer-locked Berry curvature can be manipulated by the axion field formed from the dot product of the electric and magnetic field vectors. Our results offer new pathways to detect and manipulate the internal spatial structure of fully compensated topological antiferromagnets4\textendash 9. The layer-locked Berry curvature represents a first step towards spatial engineering of the Berry phase through effects such as layer-specific moir\'e potential.}

  abstract = {An intrinsic magnetic topological insulator (TI) is a stoichiometric magnetic compound possessing both inherent magnetic order and topological electronic states. Such a material can provide a shortcut to various novel topological quantum effects but remained elusive experimentally for a long time. Here we report the experimental realization of thin films of an intrinsic magnetic TI, MnBi 2 Te 4 , by alternate growth of a Bi 2 Te 3 quintuple layer and a MnTe bilayer with molecular beam epitaxy. The material shows the archetypical Dirac surface states in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and is demonstrated to be an antiferromagnetic topological insulator with ferromagnetic surfaces by magnetic and transport measurements as well as first-principles calculations. The unique magnetic and topological electronic structures and their interplays enable the material to embody rich quantum phases such as quantum anomalous Hall insulators and axion insulators at higher temperature and in a well-controlled way.}

  abstract = {An axion insulator is a correlated topological phase, which is predicted to arise from the formation of a charge-density wave in a Weyl semimetal1,2\textemdash that is, a material in which electrons behave as massless chiral fermions. The accompanying sliding mode in the charge-density-wave phase\textemdash the phason\textemdash is an axion3,4 and is expected to cause anomalous magnetoelectric transport effects. However, this axionic charge-density wave has not yet been experimentally detected. Here we report the observation of a large positive contribution to the magnetoconductance in the sliding mode of the charge-density-wave Weyl semimetal (TaSe4)2I for collinear electric and magnetic fields. The positive contribution to the magnetoconductance originates from the anomalous axionic contribution of the chiral anomaly to the phason current, and is locked to the parallel alignment of the electric and magnetic fields. By rotating the magnetic field, we show that the angular dependence of the magnetoconductance is consistent with the anomalous transport of an axionic charge-density wave. Our results show that it is possible to find experimental evidence for axions in strongly correlated topological condensed matter systems, which have so far been elusive in any other context.}

  abstract = {If a three-dimensional semimetal or doped semiconductor is placed in a sufficiently strong magnetic field, then a change in its transport properties will occur. If the electron-impurity interaction is dominant, then the magnetic field will produce localization of the electron wavefunctions, sometimes described as magnetic freezeout. If the electron-electron interaction is more important, then some type of collective transition may occur. Spin-density waves, charge-density waves, valley-density waves, excitonic insulators, and Wigner crystallization have been proposed to occur under various circumstances. As a generalization to three-dimensions of the integral quantized Hall effect, we show that for electrons in periodic or quasiperiodic potential, when the Fermi level lies in an energy gap, the zero temperature conductivity tensor is given by {$\sigma$}ij=(e2/2{$\pi$}h){$\sum$}k{$\epsilon$}ijkGk, where \textbackslash vecG is a reciprocal-lattice-vector of the potential. We discuss the effect of impurities and dislocations on this result.}

Exotic spin-transport phenomena, such as the dissipationless quantum spin Hall effect, have been speculated to originate from a topological order whose identification requires a spin-sensitive measurement, which does not exist to this date in any system. Using Mott polarimetry, we probed the spin degrees of freedom and demonstrated that topological quantum numbers are completely determined from spin texture\textendash imaging measurements. Applying this method to Sb and Bi1\textendash xSbx, we identified the origin of its topological order and unusual chiral properties. These results taken together constitute the first observation of surface electrons collectively carrying a topological quantum Berry's phase and definite spin chirality, which are the key electronic properties component for realizing topological quantum computing bits with intrinsic spin Hall\textendash like topological phenomena.}

  abstract = {Topological crystalline insulators are new states of matter in which the topological nature of electronic structures arises from crystal symmetries. Here we predict the first material realization of topological crystalline insulator in the semiconductor SnTe by identifying its non-zero topological index. We predict that as a manifestation of this non-trivial topology, SnTe has metallic surface states with an even number of Dirac cones on high-symmetry crystal surfaces such as \{001\}, \{110\} and \{111\}. These surface states form a new type of high-mobility chiral electron gas, which is robust against disorder and topologically protected by reflection symmetry of the crystal with respect to \{110\} mirror plane. Breaking this mirror symmetry via elastic strain engineering or applying an in-plane magnetic field can open up a continuously tunable band gap on the surface, which may lead to wide-ranging applications in thermoelectrics, infra-red detection and tunable electronics. Closely related semiconductors PbTe and PbSe also become topological crystalline insulators after band inversion by pressure, strain and alloying.}

Also, as a higher order bulk boundary correspondence is involved here, a 3D TCI can support 1D helical edge states. Using first-principles band structures calculations, we identify the van der Waals material {$\alpha$}-Bi\&lt;sub\&gt;4\&lt;/sub\&gt;Br\&lt;sub\&gt;4\&lt;/sub\&gt; as a purely rotation symmetry protected TCI. We show that the (010) surface of Bi\&lt;sub\&gt;4\&lt;/sub\&gt;Br\&lt;sub\&gt;4\&lt;/sub\&gt; exhibits a pair of unpinned topological Dirac fermions related to the presence of a two-fold rotation axis. These unpinned Dirac fermions possess an exotic spin texture, which will be highly favorable for spin transport, and a band structure that consists of van Hove singularities due to a Lifshitz transition. We also identify 1D topological hinge states along the edges of an {$\alpha$}-Bi\&lt;sub\&gt;4\&lt;/sub\&gt;Br\&lt;sub\&gt;4\&lt;/sub\&gt; rod.

  abstract = {Much of the dramatic growth in research on topological materials has focused on topologically protected surface states. While the domain walls of topological materials such as Weyl semimetals with broken inversion or time-reversal symmetry can provide a hunting ground for exploring topological interfacial states, such investigations have received little attention to date. Here, utilizing in-situ cryogenic transmission electron microscopy combined with first-principles calculations, we discover intriguing domain-wall structures in MoTe2, both between polar variants of the low-temperature(T) Weyl phase, and between this and the high-T higher-order topological phase. We demonstrate how polar domain walls can be manipulated with electron beams and show that phase domain walls tend to form superlattice-like structures along the c axis. Scanning tunneling microscopy indicates a possible signature of a conducting hinge state at phase domain walls. Our results open avenues for investigating topological interfacial states and unveiling multifunctional aspects of domain walls in topological materials.}

  abstract = {WTe2, as a type-II Weyl semimetal, has 2D Fermi arcs on the (001) surface in the bulk and 1D helical edge states in its monolayer. These features have recently attracted wide attention in condensed matter physics. However, in the intermediate regime between the bulk and monolayer, the edge states have not been resolved owing to its closed band gap which makes the bulk states dominant. Here, we report the signatures of the edge superconductivity by superconducting quantum interference measurements in multilayer WTe2 Josephson junctions and we directly map the localized supercurrent. In thick WTe2 ( sim 60 rm  nm ) , the supercurrent is uniformly distributed by bulk states with symmetric Josephson effect ( |  I\_c{$^+$} ( B )  |  =  |  I\_c{$^-$} ( B )  |   ). In thin WTe2 (10 nm), however, the supercurrent becomes confined to the edge and its width reaches up to  1.4 rm   mu m   and exhibits non-symmetric behavior  |  I\_c{$^+$} ( B )  |  ne |  I\_c{$^-$} ( B )  | . The ability to tune the edge domination by changing thickness and the edge superconductivity establishes WTe2 as a promising topological system with exotic quantum phases and a rich physics.}

  abstract = {Superspace groups have been introduced to describe the symmetry of n-dimensional incommensurate crystal phases. The (n + d)-dimensional Euclidean space in which these groups act as space groups has a distinguished n-dimensional subspace called position space. This implies that superspace groups are not merely (n + d)-dimensional space groups but that they have additional structure. Here the mathematical structure and properties of these groups is discussed. It is shown that the usual crystallographic concepts can be generalized. Taking into account the additional structure a definition is given for the equivalence of superspace groups. From this equivalence relation follow the equivalence relations for point groups and for lattices. A constructive method is given for the derivation of all (n + d)-dimensional superspace groups, their arithmetic and geometric crystal classes and their corresponding lattices starting from a knowledge of the n- and d-dimensional crystal classes. For the major part of the theory the fact that the crystal phase is incommensurate is not essential. At the end the consequences of the incommensurability are discussed.}

In the early sixties of the last century compounds were found which for many reasons should be called crystals, but were not lattice periodic. This opened the field of aperiodic crystals. An overview of this development is given. Many materials of this kind were found, sometimes with very interesting properties. In the beginning the development was slow, but the number of structures of this type increased enormously. In the meantime hundreds of scientists have contributed to this field using a multi-disciplinary approach.},

From the LEED and DFT analyses, we find small but non-negligible surface relaxation that gradually decays in an oscillatory manner inside the first WTe 2 layer. In addition, the DFT calculations reveal that the Fermi surface topology is sensitive to this relaxation. These results are helpful for understanding the exotic properties of WTe 2 .}

  abstract = {A spin-1/2 system on a honeycomb lattice is studied. The interactions between nearest neighbors are of XX, YY or ZZ type, depending on the direction of the link; different types of interactions may differ in strength. The model is solved exactly by a reduction to free fermions in a static Z2 gauge field. A phase diagram in the parameter space is obtained. One of the phases has an energy gap and carries excitations that are Abelian anyons. The other phase is gapless, but acquires a gap in the presence of magnetic field. In the latter case excitations are non-Abelian anyons whose braiding rules coincide with those of conformal blocks for the Ising model. We also consider a general theory of free fermions with a gapped spectrum, which is characterized by a spectral Chern number {$\nu$}. The Abelian and non-Abelian phases of the original model correspond to {$\nu$}=0 and {$\nu$}={$\pm$}1, respectively. The anyonic properties of excitation depend on {$\nu$} mod 16, whereas {$\nu$} itself governs edge thermal transport. The paper also provides mathematical background on anyons as well as an elementary theory of Chern number for quasidiagonal matrices.}

  abstract = {Recent theory predicted that the quantum spin Hall effect, a fundamentally new quantum state of matter that exists at zero external magnetic field, may be realized in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells. We fabricated such sample structures with low density and high mobility in which we could tune, through an external gate voltage, the carrier conduction from n-type to p-type, passing through an insulating regime. For thin quantum wells with well width d \&lt; 6.3 nanometers, the insulating regime showed the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker quantum wells (d \&gt; 6.3 nanometers), the nominally insulating regime showed a plateau of residual conductance close to 2e2/h, where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant. The residual conductance was independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance was destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The quantum phase transition at the critical thickness, d = 6.3 nanometers, was also independently determined from the magnetic field\textendash induced insulator-to-metal transition. These observations provide experimental evidence of the quantum spin Hall effect.}

  abstract = {The microscopic mechanisms responsible for both the formation and coupling of magnetic moments in Heusler alloys (X2Mn Y) are identified. We find that the X atoms (e.g., Cu, Pd) serve primarily to determine the lattice constant, while the Y atoms (e.g., Al, In, Sb) mediate the interaction between the Mn d states. There is no significant direct interaction between the Mn atoms, but the occupied d states of Mn are delocalized by their strong interaction with the X-atom d states. The localized character of the magnetization results from the exclusion of minority-spin (defined locally) electrons from the Mn 3d shell. The coupling between the localized magnetic Mn moments can be described with the Heisenberg Hamiltonian and the sign of the exchange constants results from a competition between the intra-atomic magnetic energy and interatomic Y-atom mediated covalent interactions between the the Mn d states. These effects compete because the covalent mechanism is possible only for antiferromagnetic alignments, but necessarily reduces the magnitude of the local moments. The sensitive dependence of magnetic order on the occupation of the mediating p-d hybrid states accounts well for experiments by Webster in which this occupation is varied by alloying. Our analysis is based on self-consistent, spin-polarized energy-band calculations for Co2MnAl, Co2MnSn, Ni2MnSn, Cu2MnAl, Cu2MnSn, Pd2MnIn, Pd2MnSn, and Pd2MnSb, for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin alignments.},

  abstract = {Chiral anomalies give rise to dissipationless transport phenomena such as the chiral magnetic and vortical effects. In these notes I review the theory from a quantum field theoretic, hydrodynamic and holographic perspective. A physical interpretation of the otherwise somewhat obscure concepts of consistent and covariant anomalies will be given. Vanishing of the CME in strict equilibrium will be connected to the boundary conditions in momentum space imposed by the regularization. The role of the gravitational anomaly will be explained. That it contributes to transport in an unexpectedly low order in the derivative expansion can be easiest understood via holography. Anomalous transport is supposed to play also a key role in understanding the electronics of advanced materials, the Dirac- and Weyl (semi)metals. Anomaly related phenomena such as negative magnetoresistivity, anomalous Hall effect, thermal anomalous Hall effect and Fermi arcs can be understood via anomalous transport. Finally I briefly review a holographic model of Weyl semimetal which allows to infer a new phenomenon related to the gravitational anomaly: the presence of odd viscosity.},

  abstract = {Abstract The discovery of new catalysts that are efficient and sustainable is a major research endeavor for many industrial chemical processes. This requires an understanding and determination of the catalytic origins, which remains a challenge. Here, a novel method to identify the position of active sites based on searching for crystalline symmetry-protected obstructed atomic insulators (OAIs) that have metallic surface states is described. The obstructed Wannier charge centers (OWCCs) in OAIs are pinned by symmetries at some empty Wyckoff positions so that surfaces that accommodate these sites are guaranteed to have metallic obstructed surface states (OSSs). It is proposed and confirmed that the OSSs are the catalytic activity origins for crystalline materials. The theory on 2H-MoTe2, 1T{${'}$}-MoTe2, and NiPS3 bulk single crystals is verified, whose active sites are consistent with the calculations. Most importantly, several high-efficiency catalysts are successfully identified just by considering the number of OWCCs and the symmetry. Using the real-space-invariant theory applied to a database of 34 013 topologically trivial insulators, 1788 unique OAIs are identified, of which 465 are potential high-performance catalysts. The new methodology will facilitate and accelerate the discovery of new catalysts for a wide range of heterogeneous redox reactions.},

  abstract = {We investigate interaction effects in three dimensional weak topological insulators (TI) with an even number of Dirac cones on the surface. We find that the surface states can be gapped by a surface charge density wave (CDW) order without breaking the time-reversal symmetry. In this sense, time-reversal symmetry alone cannot robustly protect the weak TI state in the presence of interactions. If the translational symmetry is additionally imposed in the bulk, a topologically non-trivial weak TI state can be obtained with helical edge states on the CDW domain walls. In other words, a CDW domain wall on the surface is topologically equivalent to the edge of a two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulator. Therefore, the surface state of a weak topological insulator with translation symmetry breaking on the surface has a ``half quantum spin Hall effect'', in the same way that the surface state of a strong topological insulator with time-reversal symmetry breaking on the surface has a ``half quantum Hall effect''. The on-site and nearest neighbor interactions are investigated in the mean field level and the phase diagram for the surface states of weak topological insulators is obtained.}

A number of WSMs that break inversion symmetry have been identified, but showing unambiguously that a material is a time-reversal-breaking WSM is tricky. Three groups now provide spectroscopic evidence for this latter state in magnetic materials (see the Perspective by da Silva Neto). Belopolski et al. probed the material Co2MnGa using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, revealing exotic drumhead surface states. Using the same technique, Liu et al. studied the material Co3Sn2S2, which was complemented by the scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements of Morali et al. These magnetic WSM states provide an ideal setting for exotic transport effects.Science, this issue p. 1278, p. 1282, p. 1286; see also p. 1248Weyl semimetals are crystalline solids that host emergent relativistic Weyl fermions and have characteristic surface Fermi-arcs in their electronic structure. Weyl semimetals with broken time reversal symmetry are difficult to identify unambiguously. In this work, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we visualized the electronic structure of the ferromagnetic crystal Co3Sn2S2 and discovered its characteristic surface Fermi-arcs and linear bulk band dispersions across the Weyl points. These results establish Co3Sn2S2 as a magnetic Weyl semimetal that may serve as a platform for realizing phenomena such as chiral magnetic effects, unusually large anomalous Hall effect and quantum anomalous Hall effect.}

  abstract = {The intricate interplay between non-trivial topology and magnetism in two-dimensional materials can lead to the emergence of interesting phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Here we investigate the quantum transport of both bulk crystal and exfoliated MnBi2Te4 flakes in a field-effect transistor geometry. For the six septuple-layer device tuned into the insulating regime, we observe a large longitudinal resistance and zero Hall plateau, which are characteristics of an axion insulator state. The robust axion insulator state occurs in zero magnetic field, over a wide magnetic-field range and at relatively high temperatures. Moreover, a moderate magnetic field drives a quantum phase transition from the axion insulator phase to a Chern insulator phase with zero longitudinal resistance and quantized Hall resistance h/e2, where h is Planck\^aEUR(tm)s constant and e is electron charge. Our results pave the way for using even-number septuple-layer MnBi2Te4 to realize the quantized topological magnetoelectric effect and axion electrodynamics in condensed matter systems.}

  abstract = {Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) \textemdash{} an experimental technique based on the photoelectric effect \textemdash{} is arguably the most powerful method for probing the electronic structure of solids. The past decade has witnessed notable progress in ARPES, including the rapid development of soft-X-ray ARPES, time-resolved ARPES, spin-resolved ARPES and spatially resolved ARPES, as well as considerable improvements in energy and momentum resolution. Consequently, ARPES has emerged as an indispensable experimental probe in the study of topological materials, which have characteristic non-trivial bulk and surface electronic structures that can be directly detected by ARPES. Over the past few years, ARPES has had a crucial role in several landmark discoveries in topological materials, including the identification of topological insulators and topological Dirac and Weyl semimetals. In this Technical Review, we assess the latest developments in different ARPES techniques and illustrate the capabilities of these techniques with applications in the study of topological materials.}

Using K-theory, a classification of topologically stable Fermi surfaces in (semi-)metals and nodal lines in superconductors is derived. We discuss a generalized bulk?\dbend\dbend boundary correspondence that relates the topological features of the Fermi surfaces and superconducting nodal lines to the presence of protected zero-energy states at the boundary of the system. Depending on the case, the boundary states are either linearly dispersing (i.e. Dirac or Majorana states) or dispersionless, forming two-dimensional surface flat bands or one-dimensional arc surface states. We study examples of gapless topological phases in symmetry classes AIII and DIII, focusing in particular on nodal superconductors, such as nodal noncentrosymmetric superconductors. For some cases we explicitly compute the surface spectrum and examine the signatures of the topological boundary states in the surface density of states. We also discuss the robustness of the surface states against disorder.}

  abstract = {A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator features a 2D surface state consisting of a single linearly dispersive Dirac cone1\textendash 3. Under broken time-reversal symmetry, the single Dirac cone is predicted to cause half-integer quantization of Hall conductance, which is a manifestation of the parity anomaly in quantum field theory1\textendash 9. However, despite various observations of quantization phenomena10\textendash 15, the half-integer quantization has not been observed because most experiments simultaneously measure a pair of equivalent Dirac cones16 on two opposing surfaces. Here we demonstrate the half-integer quantization of Hall conductance in a synthetic heterostructure termed a semi-magnetic topological insulator, where only one surface state is gapped by magnetic doping and the opposite one is non-magnetic and gapless. We observe half-quantized Faraday and Kerr rotations with terahertz magneto-optical spectroscopy and half-quantized Hall conductance in transport at zero magnetic field. Our results suggest a condensed-matter realization of the parity anomaly4\textendash 9 and open a way for studying the physics enabled by a single Dirac fermion.}

  abstract = {Weyl semimetals (WSMs)\textemdash materials that host exotic quasiparticles called Weyl fermions\textemdash must break either spatial inversion or time-reversal symmetry. A number of WSMs that break inversion symmetry have been identified, but showing unambiguously that a material is a time-reversal-breaking WSM is tricky. Three groups now provide spectroscopic evidence for this latter state in magnetic materials (see the Perspective by da Silva Neto). Belopolski et al. probed the material Co2MnGa using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, revealing exotic drumhead surface states. Using the same technique, Liu et al. studied the material Co3Sn2S2, which was complemented by the scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements of Morali et al. These magnetic WSM states provide an ideal setting for exotic transport effects.Science, this issue p. 1278, p. 1282, p. 1286; see also p. 1248Bulk\textendash surface correspondence in Weyl semimetals ensures the formation of topological ``Fermi arc'' surface bands whose existence is guaranteed by bulk Weyl nodes. By investigating three distinct surface terminations of the ferromagnetic semimetal Co3Sn2S2, we verify spectroscopically its classification as a time-reversal symmetry-broken Weyl semimetal. We show that the distinct surface potentials imposed by three different terminations modify the Fermi-arc contour and Weyl node connectivity. On the tin (Sn) surface, we identify intra\textendash Brillouin zone Weyl node connectivity of Fermi arcs, whereas on cobalt (Co) termination, the connectivity is across adjacent Brillouin zones. On the sulfur (S) surface, Fermi arcs overlap with nontopological bulk and surface states. We thus resolve both topologically protected and nonprotected electronic properties of a Weyl semimetal.}

  abstract = {There are a variety of nonlinear optical effects including higher harmonic generations, photovoltaic effects, and nonlinear Kerr rotations. They are realized by the strong light irradiation to materials that results in nonlinear polarizations in the electric field. These are of great importance in studying the physics of excited states of the system as well as for applications to optical devices and solar cells. Nonlinear properties of materials are usually described by the nonlinear susceptibilities \$\textbackslash textbackslashchi\$'s, which have complex expressions including many matrix elements and energy denominators. On the other hand, a nonequilibrium steady state under a electric field periodic in time has a concise description in terms of the Floquet bands of electrons dressed by photons. Here, we theoretically show by using the Floquet formalism that various nonlinear optical effects, such as the shift current in noncentrosymmetric materials, photovoltaic Hall response, and photo-induced change of order parameters under the continuous irradiation of monochromatic light, can be described in a unified fashion by topological quantities involving the Berry connection and Berry curvature. It is found that vector fields defined with the Berry connections in the space of momentum and/or parameters govern the nonlinear responses. This topological view offers a new route to design the nonlinear optical materials.},

  abstract = {A Weyl semimetal with strong electron-phonon interaction can show axionic coupling in its insulator state at low temperatures, owing to the formation of a charge density wave (CDW). Such a CDW emerges in the linear chain compound Weyl semimetal Ta2Se8I below 263 K, resulting in the appearance of the dynamical condensed-matter axion quasiparticle. In this study, we demonstrate that the interchain coupling in Ta2Se8I can be varied to suppress the CDW formation with pressure, while retaining the Weyl semimetal phase at high temperatures. Above 17 GPa, the Weyl semimetal phase does not survive and we induce superconductivity, due to the amorphization of the iodine sub-lattice. Structurally, the one-dimensional Ta-Se-chains remain intact and provide a superconducting channel in one dimension. We highlight that our results show a near-complete suppression of the gap induced by the axionic charge-density wave at pressures inaccessible to previous studies. Including this CDW phase, our experiments and theoretical predictions and analysis reveal the complete topological phase diagram of Ta2Se8I and its relationship to the nearby superconducting state. The results demonstrate Ta2Se8I to be a distinctively versatile platform for exploring correlated topological states.},

  abstract = {Although microscopic laws of physics are invariant under the reversal of the arrow of time, the transport of energy and information in most devices is an irreversible process. It is this irreversibility that leads to intrinsic dissipations in electronic devices and limits the possibility of quantum computation. We theoretically predict that the electric field can induce a substantial amount of dissipationless quantum spin current at room temperature, in hole-doped semiconductors such as Si, Ge, and GaAs. On the basis of a generalization of the quantum Hall effect, the predicted effect leads to efficient spin injection without the need for metallic ferromagnets. Principles found here could enable quantum spintronic devices with integrated information processing and storage units, operating with low power consumption and performing reversible quantum computation.}

  abstract = {We used screw dislocations as a tool to probe spectroscopically the topological classification of electronic matter in bismuth. The growing diversity of topological classes leads to ambiguity between classes that share similar boundary phenomenology. This is the status of bulk bismuth. Recent studies have classified it as either a strong or a higher-order topological insulator, both of which host helical modes on their boundaries. We resolve the topological classification of bismuth by spectroscopically mapping the response of its boundary modes to a screw-dislocation. We find that the one-dimensional mode, on step-edges, extends over a wide energy range and does not open a gap near the screw-dislocations. This signifies that this mode binds to the screw-dislocation, as expected for a material with nonzero weak indices. We argue that the small energy gap, at the time reversal invariant momentum L, positions bismuth within the critical region of a topological phase transition between a higher-order topological insulator and a strong topological insulator with nonzero weak indices.}

  abstract = {Various techniques for the computation of the fractional fermion number of topological solitons are reviewed. First the original calculation by Jackiw and Rebbi and the relevance of fermion number fractionization in polymer physics are discussed. Subsequently, techniques for computing the fermion number in increasingly more general models are developed with applications to one-dimensional solitons, vortices in 2 + 1 dimensions and 3 + 1 dimensional magnetic monopoles. At each stage the connections between the fermion number calculation and the general properties of the spectrum, in particular the spectral asymmetry of the pertinent Dirac operator are exposed. Topological methods for computing the fermion number are developed for a large class of Dirac Hamiltonians. The adiabatic method of Goldstone and Wilczek is then introduced and applied to the Skyrme model. Finally, an exact technique for the computation of the fermion number is developed by deriving an open space generalization of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem and as an application the baryon number of a chiral bag is computed.},

  abstract = {Low-dimensional van der Waals materials have been extensively studied as a platform with which to generate quantum effects. Advancing this research, topological quantum materials with van der Waals structures are currently receiving a great deal of attention. Here, we use the concept of designing topological materials by the van der Waals stacking of quantum spin Hall insulators. Most interestingly, we find that a slight shift of inversion centre in the unit cell caused by a modification of stacking induces a transition from a trivial insulator to a higher-order topological insulator. Based on this, we present angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy results showing that the real three-dimensional material Bi4Br4 is a higher-order topological insulator. Our demonstration that various topological states can be selected by stacking chains differently, combined with the advantages of van der Waals materials, offers a playground for engineering topologically non-trivial edge states towards future spintronics applications.}

  abstract = {The interplay between symmetry and topology leads to a rich variety of electronic topological phases, protecting states such as the topological insulators and Dirac semimetals. Previous results, like the Fu-Kane parity criterion for inversion-symmetric topological insulators, demonstrate that symmetry labels can sometimes unambiguously indicate underlying band topology. Here we develop a systematic approach to expose all such symmetry-based indicators of band topology in all the 230 space groups. This is achieved by first developing an efficient way to represent band structures in terms of elementary basis states, and then isolating the topological ones by removing the subset of atomic insulators, defined by the existence of localized symmetric Wannier functions. Aside from encompassing all earlier results on such indicators, including in particular the notion of filling-enforced quantum band insulators, our theory identifies symmetry settings with previously hidden forms of band topology, and can be applied to the search for topological materials.}

  abstract = {Topological materials are quantum materials with nontrivial ground-state entanglement that are irremovable so long as certain rules, like invariance under symmetries and the existence of an energy gap, are respected. They showcase unconventional properties like robust anomalous surface states and quantized physical responses. The intense research efforts in understanding topological materials result in a modernized perspective on the decades-old theory of symmetry representations in electronic band structures, and inspire the development of general theories that enable the efficient diagnosis of topological materials using only symmetry data. One example is the theory of symmetry indicators of band topology, which is the focus of this topical review. We will aim at providing a pedagogical introduction to the key concepts and constructions in the theory, alongside with a brief summary of the latest development.}

  abstract = {Magnetically doped topological insulators enable the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), which provides quantized edge states for lossless charge-transport applications1-8. The edge states are hosted by a magnetic energy gap at the Dirac point2, but hitherto all attempts to observe this gap directly have been unsuccessful. Observing the gap is considered to be essential to overcoming the limitations of the QAHE, which so far occurs only at temperatures that are one to two orders of magnitude below the ferromagnetic Curie temperature, TC (ref. 8). Here we use low-temperature photoelectron spectroscopy to unambiguously reveal the magnetic gap of Mn-doped Bi2Te3, which displays ferromagnetic out-of-plane spin texture and opens up only below TC. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals large gap sizes at 1?kelvin of up to 90?millielectronvolts, which is five times larger than theoretically predicted9. Using multiscale analysis we show that this enhancement is due to a remarkable structure modification induced by Mn doping: instead of a disordered impurity system, a self-organized alternating sequence of MnBi2Te4 septuple and Bi2Te3 quintuple layers is formed. This enhances the wavefunction overlap and size of the magnetic gap10. Mn-doped Bi2Se3 (ref. 11) and Mn-doped Sb2Te3 form similar heterostructures, but for Bi2Se3 only a nonmagnetic gap is formed and the magnetization is in the surface plane. This is explained by the smaller spin-orbit interaction by comparison with Mn-doped Bi2Te3. Our findings provide insights that will be crucial in pushing lossless transport in topological insulators towards room-temperature applications.}

  abstract = {Carrier and collective mode dynamics in the quasi onedimensional charge density wave (CDW) system (TaSe4)2I have been investigated by means of time-resolved optical pump-probe spectroscopy. In the low excitation, linear, regime we focus on the temperature dependence of the collective amplitude modes, originating from linear coupling of the electronic modulation to phonons at qCDW. Numerous amplitude modes are observed, ranging from 100 GHz to several THz. The modes\^a softening near Tc is rather weak, which could be related to strong decoupling of electronic and lattice subsystems. Alternatively, the data could be reconciled also in case the CDW phase transition is of the \"i{$\lnot$}rst-order type where a nearly constant order parameter below Tc would prevent softening. In the high excitation regime we investigated the energetics of the photoinduced CDW-normal phase transition. Similarly to the elaborately investigated one-dimensional CDW system K0.3MoO3 we observe two characteristic energy scales, related to melting the electronic modulation alone (100 meV per unit cell) and to the overall (electronic modulation and the periodic lattice distortion) collapse of the CDW (\textbackslash textgreater 400 meV per unit cell). While the latter coincides with the thermal energy needed to heat the sample from 5 K above Tc the former is consistent with the mean \"i{$\lnot$}eld estimate for the electronic condensation energy, suggesting that the weak coupling description of the CDW in (TaSe4)2I is appropriate.},

  abstract = {A new class of materials that are insulating in the bulk and on surfaces but have conducting hinge channels is studied. Three-dimensional topological (crystalline) insulators are materials with an insulating bulk but conducting surface states that are topologically protected by time-reversal (or spatial) symmetries. We extend the notion of three-dimensional topological insulators to systems that host no gapless surface states but exhibit topologically protected gapless hinge states. Their topological character is protected by spatiotemporal symmetries of which we present two cases: (i) Chiral higher-order topological insulators protected by the combination of time-reversal and a fourfold rotation symmetry. Their hinge states are chiral modes, and the bulk topology is Z2-classified. (ii) Helical higher-order topological insulators protected by time-reversal and mirror symmetries. Their hinge states come in Kramers pairs, and the bulk topology is Z-classified. We provide the topological invariants for both cases. Furthermore, we show that SnTe as well as surface-modified Bi2TeI, BiSe, and BiTe are helical higher-order topological insulators and propose a realistic experimental setup to detect the hinge states.}

  abstract = {The mathematical field of topology has become a framework in which to describe the low-energy electronic structure of crystalline solids. Typical of a bulk insulating three-dimensional topological crystal are conducting two-dimensional surface states. This constitutes the topological bulk\textendash boundary correspondence. Here, we establish that the electronic structure of bismuth, an element consistently described as bulk topologically trivial, is in fact topological and follows a generalized bulk\textendash boundary correspondence of higher-order: not the surfaces of the crystal, but its hinges host topologically protected conducting modes. These hinge modes are protected against localization by time-reversal symmetry locally, and globally by the three-fold rotational symmetry and inversion symmetry of the bismuth crystal. We support our claim theoretically and experimentally. Our theoretical analysis is based on symmetry arguments, topological indices, first-principles calculations, and the recently introduced framework of topological quantum chemistry. We provide supporting evidence from two complementary experimental techniques. With scanning-tunnelling spectroscopy, we probe the signatures of the rotational symmetry of the one-dimensional states located at the step edges of the crystal surface. With Josephson interferometry, we demonstrate their universal topological contribution to the electronic transport. Our work establishes bismuth as a higher-order topological insulator.}

  abstract = {Room-temperature realization of macroscopic quantum phases is one of the major pursuits in fundamental physics1,2. The quantum spin Hall phase3\textendash 6 is a topological quantum phase that features a two-dimensional insulating bulk and a helical edge state. Here we use vector magnetic field and variable temperature based scanning tunnelling microscopy to provide micro-spectroscopic evidence for a room-temperature quantum spin Hall edge state on the surface of the higher-order topological insulator Bi4Br4. We find that the atomically resolved lattice exhibits a large insulating gap of over 200meV, and an atomically sharp monolayer step edge hosts an in-gap gapless state, suggesting topological bulk\textendash boundary correspondence. An external magnetic field can gap the edge state, consistent with the time-reversal symmetry protection inherent in the underlying band topology. We further identify the geometrical hybridization of such edge states, which not only supports the Z2 topology of the quantum spin Hall state but also visualizes the building blocks of the higher-order topological insulator phase. Our results further encourage the exploration of high-temperature transport quantization of the putative topological phase reported here.}

  abstract = {The study of spatial symmetries was accomplished during the last century and had greatly improved our understanding of the properties of solids. Nowadays, the symmetry data of any crystal can be readily extracted from standard first-principles calculation. On the other hand, the topological data (topological invariants), the defining quantities of nontrivial topological states, are in general considerably difficult to obtain, and this difficulty has critically slowed down the search for topological materials. Here we provide explicit and exhaustive mappings from symmetry data to topological data for arbitrary gapped band structure in the presence of time-reversal symmetry and any one of the 230 space groups. The mappings are completed using the theoretical tools of layer construction and symmetry-based indicators. With these results, finding topological invariants in any given gapped band structure reduces to a simple search in the mapping tables provided.}

  abstract = {A systematic method constructing functional integral representations of partition function and of the correlation function in a one-dimensional Peierls system is presented. This method is methodologically analogous to a star diagram method for superconductors developed by Gaudin and Langer. Also an effective Hamiltonian for CDW at finite temperatures is extracted from these functional integral representations. This Derivation justifies an effective phase mode Hamiltonian at T=0 introduced by Fukuyama through intuitive consideration.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, topological materials\^aEUR"in which the topology of electron bands in the bulk material leads to robust, unconventional surface states and electromagnetism\^aEUR"have attracted much attention. Although several theoretically proposed topological materials have been experimentally confirmed, extensive experimental exploration of topological properties, as well as applications in realistic devices, has been restricted by the lack of topological materials in which interference from trivial Fermi surface states is minimized. Here we apply our method of symmetry indicators to all suitable nonmagnetic compounds in all 230 possible space groups. A database search reveals thousands of candidate topological materials, of which we highlight 241 topological insulators and 142 topological crystalline insulators that have either noticeable full bandgaps or a considerable direct gap together with small trivial Fermi pockets. Furthermore, we list 692 topological semimetals that have band crossing points located near the Fermi level. These candidate materials open up the possibility of using topological materials in next-generation electronic devices.}

  abstract = {Although the richness of spatial symmetries has led to a rapidly expanding inventory of possible topological crystalline (TC) phases of electrons, physical realizations have been slow to materialize due to the practical difficulty in ascertaining band topology in realistic calculations. Here, we integrate the recently established theory of symmetry indicators of band topology into first-principles band-structure calculations, and test it on a database of previously synthesized crystals. On applying our algorithm to just 8 out of the 230 space groups, we are able to efficiently unearth topological materials and predict a diversity of topological phenomena, including: a screw-protected three-dimensional TC insulator, {$\beta$}-MoTe2, with gapped surfaces except for one-dimensional helical hinge states; a rotation-protected TC insulator, BiBr, with coexisting surface Dirac cones and hinge states; non-centrosymmetric \$\$\{\$\textbackslash backslash\$Bbb Z\}\_2\$\$Z2topological insulators undetectable using the well-established parity criterion, AgXO (X = Na, K, Rb); a Dirac semimetal MgBi2O6; a Dirac nodal-line semimetal AgF2; and a metal with three-fold degenerate band crossing near the Fermi energy, AuLiMgSn. Our work showcases how recent theoretical insights into the fundamentals of band structures can aid in the practical goal of discovering new topological materials.},

The theory manifestly satisfies the Kohn theorem and the f-sum rule, and predicts a gaped intra-Landau level collective mode with a roton minimum. In the limit of vanishing bare mass m, the correct form of the static structure factor, s(q)similar to q(4), is recovered. We establish a connection of the present approach to the fermionic Chern-Simons theory, and discuss further extensions and applications. We also make an interesting analogy of the present theory to the theory of viscoelastic fluids.},

In agreement with recent experiments the theory predicts two gapped collective modes for incompressible liquids. We argue that the presence of the above two modes is a universal property of a magnetized two-dimensional collective liquid.},

We develop codes to compute all characters of all symmetries of 26,938 stoichiometric materials, and find 3,307 topological insulators, 4,078 topological semimetals and no fragile phases. For these 7,385 materials we provide the electronic band structure, including some electronic properties (bandgap and number of electrons), symmetry indicators, and other topological information. Our results show that more than 27 per cent of all materials in nature are topological. We provide an open-source code that checks the topology of any material and allows other researchers to reproduce our results.}

  abstract = {Topological quantum chemistry and symmetry-based indicators have facilitated large-scale searches for materials with topological properties at the Fermi energy (EF). We report the implementation of a publicly accessible catalog of stable and fragile topology in all of the bands both at and away from EF in the 96,196 processable entries in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database. Our calculations, which represent the completion of the symmetry-indicated band topology of known nonmagnetic materials, have enabled the discovery of repeat-topological and supertopological materials, including rhombohedral bismuth and Bi2Mg3. We find that 52.65\% of all materials are topological at EF, roughly two-thirds of bands across all materials exhibit symmetry-indicated stable topology, and 87.99\% of all materials contain at least one stable or fragile topological band. Topologically nontrivial materials were once thought to be the exception rather than the rule. More recently, high-throughput computations have shown that many more materials are topological than was initially thought. Vergniory et al. expanded this approach to include all processable entries in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database and studied the materials' band structure both at and away from Fermi energy. The researchers found that almost 88\% of these materials had at least one topological band. \textemdash JS A large majority of materials in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database have at least one topological band.}

  abstract = {Spatial symmetries in crystals may be distinguished by whether they preserve the spatial origin. Here we study spatial symmetries that translate the origin by a fraction of the lattice period, and find that these non-symmorphic symmetries protect an exotic surface fermion whose dispersion relation is shaped like an hourglass; surface bands connect one hourglass to the next in an unbreakable zigzag pattern. These 'hourglass' fermions are formed in the large-gap insulators, KHgX (X = As, Sb, Bi), which we propose as the first material class whose band topology relies on non-symmorphic symmetries. Besides the hourglass fermion, another surface of KHgX manifests a three-dimensional generalization of the quantum spin Hall effect, which has previously been observed only in two-dimensional crystals. To describe the bulk topology of non-symmorphic crystals, we propose a non-Abelian generalization of the geometric theory of polarization. Our non-trivial topology originates from an inversion of the rotational quantum numbers, which we propose as a criterion in the search for topological materials.}

It is an open question whether a topological material that is also a superconductor can support an edge current that consists of paired excitations. W. Wang et al. studied the Weyl superconductor molybdenum ditelluride and, using systematic transport measurements in the presence of a magnetic field, revealed the signatures of an edge supercurrent.Science, this issue p. 534Edge supercurrents in superconductors have long been an elusive target. Interest in them has reappeared in the context of topological superconductivity. We report evidence for the existence of a robust edge supercurrent in the Weyl superconductor molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2). In a magnetic field B, fluxoid quantization generates a periodic modulation of the edge condensate observable as a ``fast-mode'' oscillation of the critical current Ic versus B. The fast-mode frequency is distinct from the conventional Fraunhofer oscillation displayed by the bulk supercurrent. We confirm that the fast-mode frequency increases with crystal area as expected for an edge supercurrent. In addition, weak excitation branches are resolved that display an unusual broken symmetry.}

  abstract = {Analyzing the spatial symmetries of three-dimensional (3D) crystal structures has led to the discovery of exotic types of quasiparticles and topologically nontrivial materials. Wieder et al. focus on the symmetry groups of 2D surfaces of 3D materials\textemdash the so-called wallpaper groups\textemdash and find that some of them allow for an additional topological class. This class hosts a single fourfold-degenerate Dirac fermion on the surface of the material and, on the basis of the authors' calculations, is expected to occur in the compound Sr2Pb3. Science, this issue p. 246 Symmetry considerations and ab initio calculations predict an unusual type of topological state. Materials whose gapless surface states are protected by crystal symmetries include mirror topological crystalline insulators and nonsymmorphic hourglass insulators. There exists only a very limited set of possible surface crystal symmetries, captured by the 17 ``wallpaper groups.'' Here we show that a consideration of symmetry-allowed band degeneracies in the wallpaper groups can be used to understand previously described topological crystalline insulators and to predict phenomenologically distinct examples. In particular, the two wallpaper groups with multiple glide lines, pgg and p4g, allow for a topological insulating phase whose surface spectrum consists of only a single, fourfold-degenerate, true Dirac fermion, representing an exception to a symmetry-enhanced fermion-doubling theorem. We theoretically predict the presence of this phase in Sr2Pb3 in space group 127 (P4/mbm).}

  abstract = {Dirac and Weyl semimetals both exhibit arc-like surface states. However, whereas the surface Fermi arcs in Weyl semimetals are topological consequences of the Weyl points themselves, the surface Fermi arcs in Dirac semimetals are not directly related to the bulk Dirac points, raising the question of whether there exists a topological bulk-boundary correspondence for Dirac semimetals. In this work, we discover that strong and fragile topological Dirac semimetals exhibit one-dimensional (1D) higher-order hinge Fermi arcs (HOFAs) as universal, direct consequences of their bulk 3D Dirac points. To predict HOFAs coexisting with topological surface states in solid-state Dirac semimetals, we introduce and layer a spinful model of an s\textendash d-hybridized quadrupole insulator (QI). We develop a rigorous nested Jackiw\textendash Rebbi formulation of QIs and HOFA states. Employing ab initio calculations, we demonstrate HOFAs in both the room- ({$\alpha$}) and intermediate-temperature ({$\alpha$}) phases of Cd3As2, KMgBi, and rutile-structure (\$\$ \textbackslash beta \textsuperscript{\{\vphantom\}}\textbackslash prime\vphantom\{\} \$\$-) PtO2.}

  abstract = {Topological materials discovery has evolved at a rapid pace over the past 15 years following the identification of the first nonmagnetic topological insulators (TIs), topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) and 3D topological semimetals (TSMs). Most recently, through complete analyses of symmetry-allowed band structures \textemdash{} including the theory of topological quantum chemistry (TQC) \textemdash{} researchers have determined crystal-symmetry-enhanced Wilson-loop and complete symmetry-based indicators for nonmagnetic topological phases, leading to the discovery of higher-order TCIs and TSMs. The recent application of TQC and related methods to high-throughput materials discovery has revealed that over half of the known stoichiometric, solid-state, nonmagnetic materials are topological at the Fermi level, over 85 per cent of the known stoichiometric materials host energetically isolated topological bands, and just under two-thirds of the energetically isolated bands in known materials carry the stable topology of a TI or TCI. In this Review, we survey topological electronic materials discovery in nonmagnetic crystalline solids from the prediction of the first 2D and 3D TIs to the recently introduced methods that have facilitated large-scale searches for topological materials. We also discuss future venues for the identification and manipulation of solid-state topological phases, including charge-density-wave compounds, magnetic materials, and 2D few-layer devices.}

  abstract = {Time-domain terahertz polarimetry is used to measure the fine-structure constant in the solid state. One of the long-standing predictions regarding topological insulators is the magnetoelectric effect, a coupling between a material's magnetic and electric properties. Thanks to this coupling, Maxwell's equations inside topological insulators are modified, resulting in so-called axion electrodynamics. Wu et al. used time-domain terahertz (THz) spectroscopy to observe signatures of these unusual electrodynamics in a thin film of Be2Se3. They detected tiny changes to the polarization of THz light after it passed through the thin film, confirming the expected quantization of the magnetoelectric coupling. Science, this issue p. 1124 Topological insulators have been proposed to be best characterized as bulk magnetoelectric materials that show response functions quantized in terms of fundamental physical constants. Here, we lower the chemical potential of three-dimensional (3D) Bi2Se3 films to  30 meV above the Dirac point and probe their low-energy electrodynamic response in the presence of magnetic fields with high-precision time-domain terahertz polarimetry. For fields higher than 5 tesla, we observed quantized Faraday and Kerr rotations, whereas the dc transport is still semiclassical. A nontrivial Berry's phase offset to these values gives evidence for axion electrodynamics and the topological magnetoelectric effect. The time structure used in these measurements allows a direct measure of the fine-structure constant based on a topological invariant of a solid-state system.}

We experimentally demonstrate magnetically induced spin reorientation phenomena simultaneous with a Dirac-metal to gapped-insulator transition on the surfaces of manganese-doped Bi2Se3 thin films. The resulting electronic groundstate exhibits unique hedgehog-like spin textures at low energies, which directly demonstrate the mechanics of TR symmetry breaking on the surface. We further show that an insulating gap induced by quantum tunnelling between surfaces exhibits spin texture modulation at low energies but respects TR invariance. These spin phenomena and the control of their Fermi surface geometrical phase first demonstrated in our experiments pave the way for the future realization of many predicted exotic magnetic phenomena of topological origin.}

The former leads to the versatile control of the valley pseudospin, whereas the latter gives rise to an interplay between the spin and the pseudospins.

  abstract = {Semiconducting manganese ditelluride (MnTe2) crystalizes in a high symmetry cubic structure with sufficient band gap and consists of nontoxic elements only, therefore is focused on in this work for its potential thermoelectric applications. This material intrinsically comes with a very low hole concentration of 1019,\"A\O cm,\`a\'i3, which can be successfully increased to 4,\"A\O{$\surd$}\'o,\"A\O 1020,\"A\O cm,\`a\'i3 through Ag-doping at Mn site. Such a broad carrier concentration enables an effective optimization on thermoelectric power factor, and the doping process effectively reduces the lattice thermal conductivity down to ,\`a\textordmasculine 0.5,\"A\O W/m-K due to the phonons scattered by additional point defects. As a result, a peak zT of ,\`a\textordmasculine 0.7 is obtained in p-type conduction. Moreover, the SPB model with acoustic scattering estimates the electronic properties well, which also enables insight into the underlying physical parameters related to the thermoelectric performance. Importantly, band structure calculation suggests a potentially higher thermoelectric performance for n-type conduction due to both higher band degeneracy and lower band effective mass. This work reveals MnTe2 is a novel promising thermoelectric material.},

Topological quantum chemistry4 has enabled the understanding of and the search for paramagnetic topological materials5,6. Using magnetic topological indices obtained from magnetic topological quantum chemistry (MTQC)7, here we perform a high-throughput search for magnetic topological materials based on first-principles calculations. We use as our starting point the Magnetic Materials Database on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server, which contains more than 549 magnetic compounds with magnetic structures deduced from neutron-scattering experiments, and identify 130 enforced semimetals (for which the band crossings are implied by symmetry eigenvalues), and topological insulators. For each compound, we perform complete electronic structure calculations, which include complete topological phase diagrams using different values of the Hubbard potential. Using a custom code to find the magnetic co-representations of all bands in all magnetic space groups, we generate data to be fed into the algorithm of MTQC to determine the topology of each magnetic material. Several of these materials display previously unknown topological phases, including symmetry-indicated magnetic semimetals, three-dimensional anomalous Hall insulators and higher-order magnetic semimetals. We analyse topological trends in the materials under varying interactions: 60 per cent of the 130 topological materials have topologies sensitive to interactions, and the others have stable topologies under varying interactions. We provide a materials database for future experimental studies and open-source code for diagnosing topologies of magnetic materials.}

  abstract = {The Hofstadter model, well known for its fractal butterfly spectrum, describes two-dimensional electrons under a perpendicular magnetic field, which gives rise to the integer quantum Hall effect. Inspired by the real-space building blocks of non-Abelian gauge fields from a recent experiment, we introduce and theoretically study two non-Abelian generalizations of the Hofstadter model. Each model describes two pairs of Hofstadter butterflies that are spin\textendash orbit coupled. In contrast to the original Hofstadter model that can be equivalently studied in the Landau and symmetric gauges, the corresponding non-Abelian generalizations exhibit distinct spectra due to the non-commutativity of the gauge fields. We derive the genuine (necessary and sufficient) non-Abelian condition for the two models from the commutativity of their arbitrary loop operators. At zero energy, the models are gapless and host Weyl and Dirac points protected by internal and crystalline symmetries. Double (8-fold), triple (12-fold), and quadrupole (16-fold) Dirac points also emerge, especially under equal hopping phases of the non-Abelian potentials. At other fillings, the gapped phases of the models give rise to topological insulators. We conclude by discussing possible schemes for experimental realization of the models on photonic platforms.}

  abstract = {Abstract It has been demonstrated that topological nontrivial surface states can favor heterogeneous catalysis processes such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but a further decrease in mass loading and an increase in activity are still highly challenging. The observation of massless chiral fermions associated with large topological charge and long Fermi arc (FA) surface states inspires the investigation of their relationship with the charge transfer and adsorption process in the HER. In this study, it is found that the HER efficiency of Pt-group metals can be boosted significantly by introducing topological order. A giant nontrivial topological energy window and a long topological surface FA are expected at the surface when forming chiral crystals in the space group of P213 (\#198). This makes the nontrivial topological features resistant to a large change in the applied overpotential. As HER catalysts, PtAl and PtGa chiral crystals show turnover frequencies as high as 5.6 and 17.1 s-1 and an overpotential as low as 14 and 13.3 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2. These crystals outperform those of commercial Pt and nanostructured catalysts. This work opens a new avenue for the development of high-efficiency catalysts with the strategy of topological engineering of excellent transitional catalytic materials.},

  abstract = {Topological electronic materials such as bismuth selenide, tantalum arsenide and sodium bismuthide show unconventional linear response in the bulk, as well as anomalous gapless states at their boundaries. They are of both fundamental and applied interest, with the potential for use in high-performance electronics and quantum computing. But their detection has so far been hindered by the difficulty of calculating topological invariant properties (or topological nodes), which requires both experience with materials and expertise with advanced theoretical tools. Here we introduce an effective, efficient and fully automated algorithm that diagnoses the nontrivial band topology in a large fraction of nonmagnetic materials. Our algorithm is based on recently developed exhaustive mappings between the symmetry representations of occupied bands and topological invariants. We sweep through a total of 39,519 materials available in a crystal database, and find that as many as 8,056 of them are topologically nontrivial. All results are available and searchable in a database with an interactive user interface.}
