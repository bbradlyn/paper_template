  abstract = {The prospect of studying topological matter with the precision and control of atomic physics has driven the development of many techniques for engineering artificial magnetic fields and spin-orbit interactions. Recently, the idea of introducing nontrivial topology through the use of internal (or external) atomic states as effective ``synthetic dimensions'' has garnered attraction for its versatility and possible immunity from heating. We engineer tunable gauge fields through the local control of tunneling phases in an effective two-dimensional manifold of discrete atomic momentum states. We demonstrate the ability to create homogeneous gauge fields of arbitrary value, directly imaging the site-resolved dynamics of induced chiral currents. Furthermore, we engineer the first inhomogeneous artificial gauge fields for cold atoms, observing the magnetic reflection of atoms incident upon a step-like variation of an artificial vector potential. These results open new possibilities for the study of topological phases and localization phenomena in atomic gases.},

Apart from the simple tools for retrieving the stored data, there are programs for the analysis of group\textendash subgroup relations between space groups (subgroups and supergroups, Wyckoff-position splitting schemes \i t etc.). There are also software packages studying specific problems of solid-state physics, structural chemistry and crystallography. This article reports on the programs treating representations of point and space groups. There are tools for the construction of irreducible representations, for the study of the correlations between representations of group\textendash subgroup pairs of space groups and for the decompositions of Kronecker products of representations.},

  abstract = {Weyl semimetals (WSMs)\textemdash materials that host exotic quasiparticles called Weyl fermions\textemdash must break either spatial inversion or time-reversal symmetry. A number of WSMs that break inversion symmetry have been identified, but showing unambiguously that a material is a time-reversal-breaking WSM is tricky. Three groups now provide spectroscopic evidence for this latter state in magnetic materials (see the Perspective by da Silva Neto). Belopolski et al. probed the material Co2MnGa using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, revealing exotic drumhead surface states. Using the same technique, Liu et al. studied the material Co3Sn2S2, which was complemented by the scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements of Morali et al. These magnetic WSM states provide an ideal setting for exotic transport effects.Science, this issue p. 1278, p. 1282, p. 1286; see also p. 1248Topological matter is known to exhibit unconventional surface states and anomalous transport owing to unusual bulk electronic topology. In this study, we use photoemission spectroscopy and quantum transport to elucidate the topology of the room temperature magnet Co2MnGa. We observe sharp bulk Weyl fermion line dispersions indicative of nontrivial topological invariants present in the magnetic phase. On the surface of the magnet, we observe electronic wave functions that take the form of drumheads, enabling us to directly visualize the crucial components of the bulk-boundary topological correspondence. By considering the Berry curvature field associated with the observed topological Weyl fermion lines, we quantitatively account for the giant anomalous Hall response observed in this magnet. Our experimental results suggest a rich interplay of strongly interacting electrons and topology in quantum matter.}

We demonstrate that a Weyl metal is distinguished from an ordinary ferromagnetic metal by the absence of the extrinsic and the Fermi surface part of the intrinsic contributions to the AHE, as long as the Fermi energy is sufficiently close to the Weyl nodes. The AHE in a Weyl metal is thus shown to be a purely intrinsic, universal property, fully determined by the location of the Weyl nodes in the first Brillouin zone.},

The Weyl semi-metallic phase appears between a resulting quantum Hall insulating phase and a normal insulating phase. Weyl fermions in this Weyl semi-metal, similar to Dirac fermions in graphene, have their lattice pseudo-spin locked to their momenta. We investigate surface states and Fermi arcs, and their evolution for different phases, by exactly diagonalizing the lattice model as well as by analyzing their topological origins.}

  abstract = {Time Reversal Symmetry (TRS) broken topological phases provide gapless surface states protected by topology, regardless of additional internal symmetries, spin or valley degrees of freedom. Despite the numerous demonstrations of 2D topological phases, few examples of 3D topological systems with TRS breaking exist. In this article, we devise a general strategy to design 3D Chern insulating (3D CI) cubic photonic crystals in a weakly TRS broken environment with orientable and arbitrarily large Chern vectors. The designs display topologically protected chiral and unidirectional surface states with disjoint equifrequency loops. The resulting crystals present the following characteristics: First, by increasing the Chern number, multiple surface states channels can be supported. Second, the Chern vector can be oriented along any direction simply changing the magnetization axis, opening up larger 3D CI/3D CI interfacing possibilities as compared to 2D. Third, by lowering the TRS breaking requirements, the system is ideal for realistic photonic applications where the magnetic response is weak.}

Specializing to a choice of vector potential that is spatially constant but non-Abelian, we investigate the Landau level spectrum in planar and spherical geometry, paying particular attention to the role of the total angular momentum . Then, we show that the adiabatic insertion of non-Abelian flux in a spin-polarized quantum Hall state leads to the formation of charged spin textures, which in the simplest cases can be identified with quantum Hall Skyrmions.}

We go beyond previous work by considering lattices with atoms occupying multiple Wyckoff positions. We also provide an algorithm using the Smith normal form that systematizes the derivation. The formulas determine the corner charge in 2D atomic or fragile topological insulators, as well as in three-dimensional (3D) insulators and semimetals by studying their 2D slices in momentum space. We apply our results to a 3D tight-binding model on a body-centered tetragonal lattice, whose projection into the 2D plane has two atoms in the unit cell. Our symmetry indicators correctly describe the higher-order hinge states and Fermi arcs in cases where the existing indicators do not apply.},

  abstract = {We show how general principles of symmetry in quantum mechanics lead to twisted notions of a group representation. This framework generalizes both the classical threefold way of real/complex/ quaternionic representations as well as a corresponding tenfold way which has appeared in condensed matter and nuclear physics. We establish a foundation for discussing continuous families of quantum systems. Having done so, topological phases of quantum systems can be defined as deformation classes of continuous families of gapped Hamiltonians. For free particles, there is an additional algebraic structure on the deformation classes leading naturally to notions of twisted equivariant K-theory. In systems with a lattice of translational symmetries, we show that there is a canonical twisting of the equivariant K-theory of the Brillouin torus. We give precise mathematical definitions of two invariants of the topological phases which have played an important role in the study of topological insulators. Twisted equivariant K-theory provides a finer classification of topological insulators than has been previously available.}

  abstract = {An intrinsic magnetic topological insulator (TI) is a stoichiometric magnetic compound possessing both inherent magnetic order and topological electronic states. Such a material can provide a shortcut to various novel topological quantum effects but remained elusive experimentally for a long time. Here we report the experimental realization of thin films of an intrinsic magnetic TI, MnBi 2 Te 4 , by alternate growth of a Bi 2 Te 3 quintuple layer and a MnTe bilayer with molecular beam epitaxy. The material shows the archetypical Dirac surface states in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and is demonstrated to be an antiferromagnetic topological insulator with ferromagnetic surfaces by magnetic and transport measurements as well as first-principles calculations. The unique magnetic and topological electronic structures and their interplays enable the material to embody rich quantum phases such as quantum anomalous Hall insulators and axion insulators at higher temperature and in a well-controlled way.}

  abstract = {An axion insulator is a correlated topological phase, which is predicted to arise from the formation of a charge-density wave in a Weyl semimetal1,2\textemdash that is, a material in which electrons behave as massless chiral fermions. The accompanying sliding mode in the charge-density-wave phase\textemdash the phason\textemdash is an axion3,4 and is expected to cause anomalous magnetoelectric transport effects. However, this axionic charge-density wave has not yet been experimentally detected. Here we report the observation of a large positive contribution to the magnetoconductance in the sliding mode of the charge-density-wave Weyl semimetal (TaSe4)2I for collinear electric and magnetic fields. The positive contribution to the magnetoconductance originates from the anomalous axionic contribution of the chiral anomaly to the phason current, and is locked to the parallel alignment of the electric and magnetic fields. By rotating the magnetic field, we show that the angular dependence of the magnetoconductance is consistent with the anomalous transport of an axionic charge-density wave. Our results show that it is possible to find experimental evidence for axions in strongly correlated topological condensed matter systems, which have so far been elusive in any other context.}

  abstract = {If a three-dimensional semimetal or doped semiconductor is placed in a sufficiently strong magnetic field, then a change in its transport properties will occur. If the electron-impurity interaction is dominant, then the magnetic field will produce localization of the electron wavefunctions, sometimes described as magnetic freezeout. If the electron-electron interaction is more important, then some type of collective transition may occur. Spin-density waves, charge-density waves, valley-density waves, excitonic insulators, and Wigner crystallization have been proposed to occur under various circumstances. As a generalization to three-dimensions of the integral quantized Hall effect, we show that for electrons in periodic or quasiperiodic potential, when the Fermi level lies in an energy gap, the zero temperature conductivity tensor is given by {$\sigma$}ij=(e2/2{$\pi$}h){$\sum$}k{$\epsilon$}ijkGk, where \textbackslash vecG is a reciprocal-lattice-vector of the potential. We discuss the effect of impurities and dislocations on this result.}

  abstract = {Much of the dramatic growth in research on topological materials has focused on topologically protected surface states. While the domain walls of topological materials such as Weyl semimetals with broken inversion or time-reversal symmetry can provide a hunting ground for exploring topological interfacial states, such investigations have received little attention to date. Here, utilizing in-situ cryogenic transmission electron microscopy combined with first-principles calculations, we discover intriguing domain-wall structures in MoTe2, both between polar variants of the low-temperature(T) Weyl phase, and between this and the high-T higher-order topological phase. We demonstrate how polar domain walls can be manipulated with electron beams and show that phase domain walls tend to form superlattice-like structures along the c axis. Scanning tunneling microscopy indicates a possible signature of a conducting hinge state at phase domain walls. Our results open avenues for investigating topological interfacial states and unveiling multifunctional aspects of domain walls in topological materials.}

  abstract = {Superspace groups have been introduced to describe the symmetry of n-dimensional incommensurate crystal phases. The (n + d)-dimensional Euclidean space in which these groups act as space groups has a distinguished n-dimensional subspace called position space. This implies that superspace groups are not merely (n + d)-dimensional space groups but that they have additional structure. Here the mathematical structure and properties of these groups is discussed. It is shown that the usual crystallographic concepts can be generalized. Taking into account the additional structure a definition is given for the equivalence of superspace groups. From this equivalence relation follow the equivalence relations for point groups and for lattices. A constructive method is given for the derivation of all (n + d)-dimensional superspace groups, their arithmetic and geometric crystal classes and their corresponding lattices starting from a knowledge of the n- and d-dimensional crystal classes. For the major part of the theory the fact that the crystal phase is incommensurate is not essential. At the end the consequences of the incommensurability are discussed.}

An overview of this development is given. Many materials of this kind were found, sometimes with very interesting properties. In the beginning the development was slow, but the number of structures of this type increased enormously.

  abstract = {The microscopic mechanisms responsible for both the formation and coupling of magnetic moments in Heusler alloys (X2Mn Y) are identified. We find that the X atoms (e.g., Cu, Pd) serve primarily to determine the lattice constant, while the Y atoms (e.g., Al, In, Sb) mediate the interaction between the Mn d states. There is no significant direct interaction between the Mn atoms, but the occupied d states of Mn are delocalized by their strong interaction with the X-atom d states. The localized character of the magnetization results from the exclusion of minority-spin (defined locally) electrons from the Mn 3d shell. The coupling between the localized magnetic Mn moments can be described with the Heisenberg Hamiltonian and the sign of the exchange constants results from a competition between the intra-atomic magnetic energy and interatomic Y-atom mediated covalent interactions between the the Mn d states. These effects compete because the covalent mechanism is possible only for antiferromagnetic alignments, but necessarily reduces the magnitude of the local moments. The sensitive dependence of magnetic order on the occupation of the mediating p-d hybrid states accounts well for experiments by Webster in which this occupation is varied by alloying. Our analysis is based on self-consistent, spin-polarized energy-band calculations for Co2MnAl, Co2MnSn, Ni2MnSn, Cu2MnAl, Cu2MnSn, Pd2MnIn, Pd2MnSn, and Pd2MnSb, for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin alignments.},

  abstract = {Chiral anomalies give rise to dissipationless transport phenomena such as the chiral magnetic and vortical effects. In these notes I review the theory from a quantum field theoretic, hydrodynamic and holographic perspective. A physical interpretation of the otherwise somewhat obscure concepts of consistent and covariant anomalies will be given. Vanishing of the CME in strict equilibrium will be connected to the boundary conditions in momentum space imposed by the regularization. The role of the gravitational anomaly will be explained. That it contributes to transport in an unexpectedly low order in the derivative expansion can be easiest understood via holography. Anomalous transport is supposed to play also a key role in understanding the electronics of advanced materials, the Dirac- and Weyl (semi)metals. Anomaly related phenomena such as negative magnetoresistivity, anomalous Hall effect, thermal anomalous Hall effect and Fermi arcs can be understood via anomalous transport. Finally I briefly review a holographic model of Weyl semimetal which allows to infer a new phenomenon related to the gravitational anomaly: the presence of odd viscosity.},

  abstract = {Weyl semimetals (WSMs)\textemdash materials that host exotic quasiparticles called Weyl fermions\textemdash must break either spatial inversion or time-reversal symmetry. A number of WSMs that break inversion symmetry have been identified, but showing unambiguously that a material is a time-reversal-breaking WSM is tricky. Three groups now provide spectroscopic evidence for this latter state in magnetic materials (see the Perspective by da Silva Neto). Belopolski et al. probed the material Co2MnGa using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, revealing exotic drumhead surface states. Using the same technique, Liu et al. studied the material Co3Sn2S2, which was complemented by the scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements of Morali et al. These magnetic WSM states provide an ideal setting for exotic transport effects.Science, this issue p. 1278, p. 1282, p. 1286; see also p. 1248Weyl semimetals are crystalline solids that host emergent relativistic Weyl fermions and have characteristic surface Fermi-arcs in their electronic structure. Weyl semimetals with broken time reversal symmetry are difficult to identify unambiguously. In this work, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we visualized the electronic structure of the ferromagnetic crystal Co3Sn2S2 and discovered its characteristic surface Fermi-arcs and linear bulk band dispersions across the Weyl points. These results establish Co3Sn2S2 as a magnetic Weyl semimetal that may serve as a platform for realizing phenomena such as chiral magnetic effects, unusually large anomalous Hall effect and quantum anomalous Hall effect.}

  abstract = {The intricate interplay between non-trivial topology and magnetism in two-dimensional materials can lead to the emergence of interesting phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Here we investigate the quantum transport of both bulk crystal and exfoliated MnBi2Te4 flakes in a field-effect transistor geometry. For the six septuple-layer device tuned into the insulating regime, we observe a large longitudinal resistance and zero Hall plateau, which are characteristics of an axion insulator state. The robust axion insulator state occurs in zero magnetic field, over a wide magnetic-field range and at relatively high temperatures. Moreover, a moderate magnetic field drives a quantum phase transition from the axion insulator phase to a Chern insulator phase with zero longitudinal resistance and quantized Hall resistance h/e2, where h is Planck\^aEUR(tm)s constant and e is electron charge. Our results pave the way for using even-number septuple-layer MnBi2Te4 to realize the quantized topological magnetoelectric effect and axion electrodynamics in condensed matter systems.}

Using K-theory, a classification of topologically stable Fermi surfaces in (semi-)metals and nodal lines in superconductors is derived. We discuss a generalized bulk?\dbend\dbend boundary correspondence that relates the topological features of the Fermi surfaces and superconducting nodal lines to the presence of protected zero-energy states at the boundary of the system. Depending on the case, the boundary states are either linearly dispersing (i.e. Dirac or Majorana states) or dispersionless, forming two-dimensional surface flat bands or one-dimensional arc surface states. We study examples of gapless topological phases in symmetry classes AIII and DIII, focusing in particular on nodal superconductors, such as nodal noncentrosymmetric superconductors. For some cases we explicitly compute the surface spectrum and examine the signatures of the topological boundary states in the surface density of states. We also discuss the robustness of the surface states against disorder.}

Examples are given of physically equivalent and physically inequivalent composite energy bands.

  abstract = {Weyl semimetals (WSMs)\textemdash materials that host exotic quasiparticles called Weyl fermions\textemdash must break either spatial inversion or time-reversal symmetry. A number of WSMs that break inversion symmetry have been identified, but showing unambiguously that a material is a time-reversal-breaking WSM is tricky. Three groups now provide spectroscopic evidence for this latter state in magnetic materials (see the Perspective by da Silva Neto). Belopolski et al. probed the material Co2MnGa using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, revealing exotic drumhead surface states. Using the same technique, Liu et al. studied the material Co3Sn2S2, which was complemented by the scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements of Morali et al. These magnetic WSM states provide an ideal setting for exotic transport effects.Science, this issue p. 1278, p. 1282, p. 1286; see also p. 1248Bulk\textendash surface correspondence in Weyl semimetals ensures the formation of topological ``Fermi arc'' surface bands whose existence is guaranteed by bulk Weyl nodes. By investigating three distinct surface terminations of the ferromagnetic semimetal Co3Sn2S2, we verify spectroscopically its classification as a time-reversal symmetry-broken Weyl semimetal. We show that the distinct surface potentials imposed by three different terminations modify the Fermi-arc contour and Weyl node connectivity. On the tin (Sn) surface, we identify intra\textendash Brillouin zone Weyl node connectivity of Fermi arcs, whereas on cobalt (Co) termination, the connectivity is across adjacent Brillouin zones. On the sulfur (S) surface, Fermi arcs overlap with nontopological bulk and surface states. We thus resolve both topologically protected and nonprotected electronic properties of a Weyl semimetal.}

  abstract = {There are a variety of nonlinear optical effects including higher harmonic generations, photovoltaic effects, and nonlinear Kerr rotations. They are realized by the strong light irradiation to materials that results in nonlinear polarizations in the electric field. These are of great importance in studying the physics of excited states of the system as well as for applications to optical devices and solar cells. Nonlinear properties of materials are usually described by the nonlinear susceptibilities \$\textbackslash textbackslashchi\$'s, which have complex expressions including many matrix elements and energy denominators. On the other hand, a nonequilibrium steady state under a electric field periodic in time has a concise description in terms of the Floquet bands of electrons dressed by photons. Here, we theoretically show by using the Floquet formalism that various nonlinear optical effects, such as the shift current in noncentrosymmetric materials, photovoltaic Hall response, and photo-induced change of order parameters under the continuous irradiation of monochromatic light, can be described in a unified fashion by topological quantities involving the Berry connection and Berry curvature. It is found that vector fields defined with the Berry connections in the space of momentum and/or parameters govern the nonlinear responses. This topological view offers a new route to design the nonlinear optical materials.},

  abstract = {A Weyl semimetal with strong electron-phonon interaction can show axionic coupling in its insulator state at low temperatures, owing to the formation of a charge density wave (CDW). Such a CDW emerges in the linear chain compound Weyl semimetal Ta2Se8I below 263 K, resulting in the appearance of the dynamical condensed-matter axion quasiparticle. In this study, we demonstrate that the interchain coupling in Ta2Se8I can be varied to suppress the CDW formation with pressure, while retaining the Weyl semimetal phase at high temperatures. Above 17 GPa, the Weyl semimetal phase does not survive and we induce superconductivity, due to the amorphization of the iodine sub-lattice. Structurally, the one-dimensional Ta-Se-chains remain intact and provide a superconducting channel in one dimension. We highlight that our results show a near-complete suppression of the gap induced by the axionic charge-density wave at pressures inaccessible to previous studies. Including this CDW phase, our experiments and theoretical predictions and analysis reveal the complete topological phase diagram of Ta2Se8I and its relationship to the nearby superconducting state. The results demonstrate Ta2Se8I to be a distinctively versatile platform for exploring correlated topological states.},

  abstract = {Various techniques for the computation of the fractional fermion number of topological solitons are reviewed. First the original calculation by Jackiw and Rebbi and the relevance of fermion number fractionization in polymer physics are discussed. Subsequently, techniques for computing the fermion number in increasingly more general models are developed with applications to one-dimensional solitons, vortices in 2 + 1 dimensions and 3 + 1 dimensional magnetic monopoles. At each stage the connections between the fermion number calculation and the general properties of the spectrum, in particular the spectral asymmetry of the pertinent Dirac operator are exposed. Topological methods for computing the fermion number are developed for a large class of Dirac Hamiltonians. The adiabatic method of Goldstone and Wilczek is then introduced and applied to the Skyrme model. Finally, an exact technique for the computation of the fermion number is developed by deriving an open space generalization of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem and as an application the baryon number of a chiral bag is computed.},

  abstract = {Topological materials are quantum materials with nontrivial ground-state entanglement that are irremovable so long as certain rules, like invariance under symmetries and the existence of an energy gap, are respected. They showcase unconventional properties like robust anomalous surface states and quantized physical responses. The intense research efforts in understanding topological materials result in a modernized perspective on the decades-old theory of symmetry representations in electronic band structures, and inspire the development of general theories that enable the efficient diagnosis of topological materials using only symmetry data. One example is the theory of symmetry indicators of band topology, which is the focus of this topical review. We will aim at providing a pedagogical introduction to the key concepts and constructions in the theory, alongside with a brief summary of the latest development.}

  abstract = {Magnetically doped topological insulators enable the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), which provides quantized edge states for lossless charge-transport applications1-8. The edge states are hosted by a magnetic energy gap at the Dirac point2, but hitherto all attempts to observe this gap directly have been unsuccessful. Observing the gap is considered to be essential to overcoming the limitations of the QAHE, which so far occurs only at temperatures that are one to two orders of magnitude below the ferromagnetic Curie temperature, TC (ref. 8). Here we use low-temperature photoelectron spectroscopy to unambiguously reveal the magnetic gap of Mn-doped Bi2Te3, which displays ferromagnetic out-of-plane spin texture and opens up only below TC. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals large gap sizes at 1?kelvin of up to 90?millielectronvolts, which is five times larger than theoretically predicted9. Using multiscale analysis we show that this enhancement is due to a remarkable structure modification induced by Mn doping: instead of a disordered impurity system, a self-organized alternating sequence of MnBi2Te4 septuple and Bi2Te3 quintuple layers is formed. This enhances the wavefunction overlap and size of the magnetic gap10. Mn-doped Bi2Se3 (ref. 11) and Mn-doped Sb2Te3 form similar heterostructures, but for Bi2Se3 only a nonmagnetic gap is formed and the magnetization is in the surface plane. This is explained by the smaller spin-orbit interaction by comparison with Mn-doped Bi2Te3. Our findings provide insights that will be crucial in pushing lossless transport in topological insulators towards room-temperature applications.}

  abstract = {Carrier and collective mode dynamics in the quasi onedimensional charge density wave (CDW) system (TaSe4)2I have been investigated by means of time-resolved optical pump-probe spectroscopy. In the low excitation, linear, regime we focus on the temperature dependence of the collective amplitude modes, originating from linear coupling of the electronic modulation to phonons at qCDW. Numerous amplitude modes are observed, ranging from 100 GHz to several THz. The modes\^a softening near Tc is rather weak, which could be related to strong decoupling of electronic and lattice subsystems. Alternatively, the data could be reconciled also in case the CDW phase transition is of the \"i{$\lnot$}rst-order type where a nearly constant order parameter below Tc would prevent softening. In the high excitation regime we investigated the energetics of the photoinduced CDW-normal phase transition. Similarly to the elaborately investigated one-dimensional CDW system K0.3MoO3 we observe two characteristic energy scales, related to melting the electronic modulation alone (100 meV per unit cell) and to the overall (electronic modulation and the periodic lattice distortion) collapse of the CDW (\textbackslash textgreater 400 meV per unit cell). While the latter coincides with the thermal energy needed to heat the sample from 5 K above Tc the former is consistent with the mean \"i{$\lnot$}eld estimate for the electronic condensation energy, suggesting that the weak coupling description of the CDW in (TaSe4)2I is appropriate.},

We extend the notion of three-dimensional topological insulators to systems that host no gapless surface states but exhibit topologically protected gapless hinge states. Their topological character is protected by spatiotemporal symmetries of which we present two cases: (i) Chiral higher-order topological insulators protected by the combination of time-reversal and a fourfold rotation symmetry. Their hinge states are chiral modes, and the bulk topology is -classified. (ii) Helical higher-order topological insulators protected by time-reversal and mirror symmetries. Their hinge states come in Kramers pairs, and the bulk topology is Z-classified. We provide the topological invariants for both cases. Furthermore, we show that SnTe as well as surface-modified Bi2TeI, BiSe, and BiTe are helical higher-order topological insulators and propose a realistic experimental setup to detect the hinge states.},

  abstract = {Although the richness of spatial symmetries has led to a rapidly expanding inventory of possible topological crystalline (TC) phases of electrons, physical realizations have been slow to materialize due to the practical difficulty in ascertaining band topology in realistic calculations. Here, we integrate the recently established theory of symmetry indicators of band topology into first-principles band-structure calculations, and test it on a database of previously synthesized crystals. On applying our algorithm to just 8 out of the 230 space groups, we are able to efficiently unearth topological materials and predict a diversity of topological phenomena, including: a screw-protected three-dimensional TC insulator, {$\beta$}-MoTe2, with gapped surfaces except for one-dimensional helical hinge states; a rotation-protected TC insulator, BiBr, with coexisting surface Dirac cones and hinge states; non-centrosymmetric \$\$\{\$\textbackslash backslash\$Bbb Z\}\_2\$\$Z2topological insulators undetectable using the well-established parity criterion, AgXO (X = Na, K, Rb); a Dirac semimetal MgBi2O6; a Dirac nodal-line semimetal AgF2; and a metal with three-fold degenerate band crossing near the Fermi energy, AuLiMgSn. Our work showcases how recent theoretical insights into the fundamentals of band structures can aid in the practical goal of discovering new topological materials.},

The theory manifestly satisfies the Kohn theorem and the f-sum rule, and predicts a gaped intra-Landau level collective mode with a roton minimum. In the limit of vanishing bare mass m, the correct form of the static structure factor, s(q)similar to q(4), is recovered. We establish a connection of the present approach to the fermionic Chern-Simons theory, and discuss further extensions and applications. We also make an interesting analogy of the present theory to the theory of viscoelastic fluids.},

In agreement with recent experiments the theory predicts two gapped collective modes for incompressible liquids.

  abstract = {Many materials with topologically nontrivial band structures are characterized by currents that run around the edge of the sample and typically consist of single excitations. It is an open question whether a topological material that is also a superconductor can support an edge current that consists of paired excitations. W. Wang et al. studied the Weyl superconductor molybdenum ditelluride and, using systematic transport measurements in the presence of a magnetic field, revealed the signatures of an edge supercurrent.Science, this issue p. 534Edge supercurrents in superconductors have long been an elusive target. Interest in them has reappeared in the context of topological superconductivity. We report evidence for the existence of a robust edge supercurrent in the Weyl superconductor molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2). In a magnetic field B, fluxoid quantization generates a periodic modulation of the edge condensate observable as a ``fast-mode'' oscillation of the critical current Ic versus B. The fast-mode frequency is distinct from the conventional Fraunhofer oscillation displayed by the bulk supercurrent. We confirm that the fast-mode frequency increases with crystal area as expected for an edge supercurrent. In addition, weak excitation branches are resolved that display an unusual broken symmetry.}

We experimentally demonstrate magnetically induced spin reorientation phenomena simultaneous with a Dirac-metal to gapped-insulator transition on the surfaces of manganese-doped Bi2Se3 thin films. The resulting electronic groundstate exhibits unique hedgehog-like spin textures at low energies, which directly demonstrate the mechanics of TR symmetry breaking on the surface. We further show that an insulating gap induced by quantum tunnelling between surfaces exhibits spin texture modulation at low energies but respects TR invariance. These spin phenomena and the control of their Fermi surface geometrical phase first demonstrated in our experiments pave the way for the future realization of many predicted exotic magnetic phenomena of topological origin.}

  abstract = {Semiconducting manganese ditelluride (MnTe2) crystalizes in a high symmetry cubic structure with sufficient band gap and consists of nontoxic elements only, therefore is focused on in this work for its potential thermoelectric applications. This material intrinsically comes with a very low hole concentration of 1019,\"A\O cm,\`a\'i3, which can be successfully increased to 4,\"A\O{$\surd$}\'o,\"A\O 1020,\"A\O cm,\`a\'i3 through Ag-doping at Mn site. Such a broad carrier concentration enables an effective optimization on thermoelectric power factor, and the doping process effectively reduces the lattice thermal conductivity down to ,\`a\textordmasculine 0.5,\"A\O W/m-K due to the phonons scattered by additional point defects. As a result, a peak zT of ,\`a\textordmasculine 0.7 is obtained in p-type conduction. Moreover, the SPB model with acoustic scattering estimates the electronic properties well, which also enables insight into the underlying physical parameters related to the thermoelectric performance. Importantly, band structure calculation suggests a potentially higher thermoelectric performance for n-type conduction due to both higher band degeneracy and lower band effective mass. This work reveals MnTe2 is a novel promising thermoelectric material.},

  abstract = {The Hofstadter model, well known for its fractal butterfly spectrum, describes two-dimensional electrons under a perpendicular magnetic field, which gives rise to the integer quantum Hall effect. Inspired by the real-space building blocks of non-Abelian gauge fields from a recent experiment, we introduce and theoretically study two non-Abelian generalizations of the Hofstadter model. Each model describes two pairs of Hofstadter butterflies that are spin\textendash orbit coupled. In contrast to the original Hofstadter model that can be equivalently studied in the Landau and symmetric gauges, the corresponding non-Abelian generalizations exhibit distinct spectra due to the non-commutativity of the gauge fields. We derive the genuine (necessary and sufficient) non-Abelian condition for the two models from the commutativity of their arbitrary loop operators. At zero energy, the models are gapless and host Weyl and Dirac points protected by internal and crystalline symmetries. Double (8-fold), triple (12-fold), and quadrupole (16-fold) Dirac points also emerge, especially under equal hopping phases of the non-Abelian potentials. At other fillings, the gapped phases of the models give rise to topological insulators. We conclude by discussing possible schemes for experimental realization of the models on photonic platforms.}

Continuity chords are used for proving the equivalency theorem which enables one to distinguish between equivalent and inequivalent band representations. As examples we consider a one-dimensional crystal and the D46h space group for a hexagonal close-packed structure.}
